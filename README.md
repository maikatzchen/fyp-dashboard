## Cloud Platform for Predicting Natural Disasters (FYP)

This project is a cloud-based platform designed to predict **flood events** in Malaysia, specifically states that are prone to floods like Terengganu, Kelantan and Pahang, using real-time and historical environmental data by  integrating **machine learning classification models** with cloud services to support early warning systems and disaster preparedness.

## Project Objective

To develop a scalable and intelligent cloud solution that can:
- Predict potential flood risks using AI/ML models
- Ingest and process real-time data from multiple sources
- Provide a user-friendly dashboard for early flood alerts

## Key Technologies

- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**  
  - Vertex AI (Classification Model Deployment)  
  - Google Cloud Storage  
  - Firebase 
  - App Engine  

- **Google Earth Engine (GEE)**  
  - IMERG Rainfall Data    

- **OpenWeatherMap API**
  - for real-time weather input

- **Python**
  - for data preprocessing and model training

- **Streamlit**
  - for dashboard visualization

## Features

- Real-time rainfall monitoring
- 3-day rainfall prediction based on historical data
- AI-based flood risk classification
- Interactive dashboard for visualization and alerts

## Note: This is a work in progress.
